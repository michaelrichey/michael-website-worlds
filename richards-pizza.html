        <p>Buona Pizza! Welcome to my homepage of my restaurant, Richard's Pizza World, located in the Glenmoor Commons Shopping Plaza on HWY 218. When I was a young boy I ate a slice of BELLISIMO pizza while watching the Godfather, and that's when I knew that when I grew up, I wanted to be Italian. Fifteen years later, I bought Richard's Pizza from Richard Fellini, changed my name to Richard, and started my business.</p>
        <p>Take a look around the page then come on down and visit us. And bring the family! (No singles.)</p>
