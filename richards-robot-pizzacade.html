        <p>HAPPY PIZZA! Welcome to the homepage of Richard's Robot Pizzacade Theater, located in the Glenmoor Commons Shopping Plaza on HWY 218. You may remember our location as the former home of Richard's Pizza Restaurante. It's the same great family pizza recipe I bought from Papa DiMaggio, but now with the added flavor of robot sideshows and skee ball! Nothing makes pizza taste better than the screams of children and the promise of a plastic spider ring (only 300 tickets).</p>
        <p>Take a look around the page then come on down and visit us. And bring the kids! (No childless couples.)</p>

        <h3>Martin Mouse</h3>
          <p>The leader of the group. He plays guitar and has a thick beard made of rodent hair.</p>
        <h3>Mervin Mouse</h3>
          <p>He's got glasses, what a nerd! And he plays the keyboard. Probably because he's so in love with his computer keyboard. NERD!</p>
        <h3>Muscles Mouse</h3>
          <p>You need big muscles to smash those drums. And huge neck muscles to keep a heavy golden top hat on one's mouse noggin.</p>
        <h3>Maria Mouse</h3>
          <p>The lady mouse who plays the organ. Wait a minute... What kind of band has a keyboard AND an organ? A nonsense band run by MICE, that's what kind.</p>

        <h2>GAMEZ!</h2>
        <img src="images/pizza-robot-1.gif">
        <p>Our game room has undergone a massive renovation to create the best family amusement experience possible! Our previous collection of arcade games like Road Blasters, Mappy, X-Men, Tapper, Play Choice 10, and Guantlet have all been thrown in a dumpster to make room for EVEN MORE TICKET GAMES. We now have over 50 games that shoot your tokens into various holes. Fans of "classic" arcade games can play our one Galaga cabinet in the hallway near the bathrooms.</p>
