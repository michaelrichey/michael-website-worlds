        <img src="images/dbz-main-2.jpg" class=headimg>

          <p>Goku is the leader of the Z Squad and the real heart of the team. He's a Saiyan and sometimes goes Super Saiyan when his friends need his ultimate power. He has a power pole that can extend and a magic cloud he can fly on, but now that he can go Super Saiyan, he doesn't use them anymore—he threw them both in a closet and covered them in forgotten winter coats.</p>

          <h3>Dylan Barker • Woodford, PA</h3>
          <p>Before I found DBZ, I was playing Pokemon and watching Monster Rancher. Now I only watch anime with the biggest muscles and screams. Everyone at my lunch table asks me about what happens in which sagas and who all the colorful, non-muscular characters are. Thanks, DBZ!</p>

          <p>I've watched through all the DBZ tapes and movie tapes at least seven times. I'm working on my eighth run. In my spare time, I collect Vegeta wallpapers in a folder on my desktop and create my own Yamcha Winamp skins. Thanks, DBZ!</p>
