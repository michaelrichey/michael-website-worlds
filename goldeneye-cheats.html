<h1>The Secret Goldeneye Cheats Nintendo and Rare Don't Want You To Know!</h1>

<img src="images/bond-shoot.gif">

<p>If you're like me, you've played through the Nintendo 64 hit Goldeneye backward and forward, completed all the missions, and beaten it on the hardest difficulty (00 Agent). Not only that, you totally blast all your friends in multiplayer.</p>

<p>After all that, I bet you found a complete list of cheats and codes in Nintendo Power or on GameSages. Well, let me tell you, those aren't the <em>only</em> cheats for this game. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Me and Dylan spent two whole weeks inputting every kind of code and trick into this game, and we uncovered some super secret cheats that Nintendo doesn't want you to know about. Also Rare doesn't want you to know about either. Check out the list below.</p>

  <div id=footnote>
    *1 I know that the Matrix didn't come out until 1999 and this game came out in 1997, but the code works. See for yourself. Clearly, the makers of the Matrix knew their movie would be such a big hit that they contacted Rare and asksed them to put Neo and Trinity costumes in the game.
