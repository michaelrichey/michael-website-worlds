        <p>We've all been there. You invite guests to your home, and someone says it: "Oh, I have the exact same throw pillows." Then someone else mentions, "You've got good taste in coffee tables—I've got the same one at my house."</p>
        <p>But where can you find something that sets your home apart from your neighbors'? Target? Home Goods? Pottery Barn? They all shop there too.</p>
        <p>You don't need another object placed among your other objects. You need the very walls of your house to be filled with life—small, furry life.</p>

          <h2>Let us install a mouse in your home today!</h2>
          <p>Time was you could expect near every house to have at least one mousehole carved out of a baseboard. The mouse would scurry here or there, and Ma would say, "There's that mouse again." And Pa would say, "Surely it is as you say, Mother."</p>
          <p>But modern rodent genocide technologies have all but done away with the traditional live-in mouse. That's why we're re-introducing this cozy home staple with our patented House Mouse into homes all across America.</p>
          <p>Each House Mouse comes genetically trained to leave its hole three times a day and scurry around—but never on counter or tabletops. And each House Mouse hole comes fully-furnished with tiny bed, nightstand, vanity, potbelly stove, coat rack, bookshelf, tiny books, reading chair, and fireplace.</p>
          <p>And no need to worry about your House Mouse attracting outside vermin. The House Mouse is trained to recognize and eliminate all other mice not carrying the House Mouse gene.
