      <div class="button6"><p>"The magic wasn't in your wand or your broom, Harry," said Dumbledore. "It was inside you all along. The only reason you were able to defeat Voldemort was because you believed it in your mind. And the only reason Hogwarts exists at all is because you believe. So don't stop believing! Hold onto that feeling. Streetlight. Peopleâ€”OOOOOWHOA-OOOOOOOOOH!!" Dumbledore wailed on his electric guitar, and Harry's life changed forever.</p></div>
