        <p>Don't you hate it when you get kept at night by a problem that makes you worry?</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, nothing can solve your problem. Oh no.</p>
        <p>But wait! What if that last thing was a lie, and something COULD solve your problem? That's just a fantasy though... a fantasy for a fool.</p>

          <p>Your worry can be solved by one of these! One of these will take that nagging problem and make it disappear, and your memories of that problem will go away too. Other things in your life will improve as a result. Stop wasting time with time-consuming self-improvement and just buy yourself one of these!</p>
