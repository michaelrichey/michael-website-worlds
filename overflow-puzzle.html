    <h1>What Character is it?</h1>

    <p>Hi. Welcome to the character identification puzzle zone. There are popular media characters hidden in the boxes below. But you have to guess what they are. Here's how to play:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Choose a box to puzzle with</li>
      <li>Close your eyes and guess in your mind what character you think is in the box. For example, you think: "it's Marmaduke."</li>
      <li>Use your mouse scrollers to scroll around in the box until you find the face of the media character. Was it Marmaduke?</li>
      <li>No, it wasn't Marmaduke. There's no Marmadukes on this page, Kevin. Go back to your Marmaduke deviantart. This is a Marmaduke-free zone!</li>
      <li>If you guessed right, congratulations!</li>
    </ul>
