  My name is Meff Gilden, and I'm a life-hack-preneur. Before I started my hack journey, I didn't have half the results I wanted, nor was I as productive, nor was I a life-hack-preneur.

  On this site, I've collected the top life hacks I've created that get the results you deserve. Read on and get ready for a better life.

  <h2>Top 5 Life Hacks</h2>

    <h3>The Jacket Hack</h3>

    <p>Always wear a jacket no matter the time of year, so you can hang it on the hook inside the bathroom stall to block unusually large gaps between the door and the stall wall.</p>

    <h3>The Coat Hack</h3>

    <p>Always wear a large winter coat over the jacket to drape over the second bathroom stall gap on the opposite side of the door.</p>

    <h3>The Bed Skirt Hack</h3>

    <p>Carry a queen-sized bed skirt in your back pocket and a glue stick in your front-left pocket. When you get into a bathroom stall, glue the bed skirt around the base of the stall.</p>

    <h3>The Pocket Mirror Hack</h3>

    <p>Carry a compact make-up mirror in your front-right pocket and point it upward when in a bathroom stall. That way you can keep a look out for selfie-sticks or people on step ladders who are trying to peep.</p>

    <h3>The Shoe Hack</h3>

    <p>In case your privacy curtain at the bottom of the stall comes unglued or catches fire, carry a second pair of shoes in a grocery bag. Before you leave the bathroom stall, change your shoes so when you leave no one can identify you by your footwear and yell to the whole Walgreens: "Hey! This is the guy who was pooping!"</p>
