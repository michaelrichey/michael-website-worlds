      <p>Dear Lance Crackers People,</p>

      <p>Perhaps you've noticed your sales declining recently. At least, I assume they've been declining because you know the last time I heard someone on the street say, "Mmmmm... I'm hungry for some Lance crackers, I'm gonna go buy some"? Not in a long while. In fact, I heard that only once. And that's a problem for you.</p>

      <p>Luckily, I know the source of your problem: your current website. It's "clean" and "modern" and nothing is moving or changing colors. And worst of all, there are no pictures of your famous Lance crackers truck. Just think, when a customer sees your truck rolling down the gravel road behind the elementary school, they think to themselves, "What's this Lance crackers business all about?" What do you think happens when they open their web browser to your site and they DON'T see a picture of that truck. They go buy Austin crackers, that's what happens!</p>

      <p>So if you want to see your sales go up instead of down, send me an email, and we'll work out a deal for me to sell you the code to this webpage that you can copy and paste to your site. And don't think of doing inspect element and copying it without payment, because I'll be checking your website every day to make sure you don't (I check your website every day after lunch anyway, so don't think I won't).</p>
