    <p>
      The party members in FF7 are so many, and there's so much to know about them: things like class and what weapon they use. So to help you keep straight all the characters and what their attributes are, use this searchable table. Type in any character name to see just their info. Then memorize it. That way, you'll know how to better strategize your party for fighting secret bosses like Ruby Weapon.
