        <p>You know the feeling. You rent the newest 3D adventure game from Hollywood Video, put it in your N64 (or worse, PlayStation) and within an hour you're yawning. Clunky controls, boring storyâ€”it's enough to make you throw your controller (or worse PlayStation controller) in the trash.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, all these new 3D games have these new "radical" chracters like Croc or Bug. Where's the 3D adventure game for those with classic sensibilities? Why are we throwing away our rich 20-year video game history?</p>
        <p>If only someone made a 3D adventure game that moved us forward while also honoring the past. If only traversing an open world didn't feel like piloting a tank. If only there were clay pots you could pick up and smash...</p>

          <p>The Imaginauts over at Nintendo have been busy in their imaginauriums creating the perfect 3D adventure game for the Nintedo 64. It's called <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and it can be yours to rent or own today!</p>
