        <p>You know the feeling. You rent the newest 3D adventure game from Hollywood Video, put it in your N64 (or worse, PlayStation) and within an hour you're yawning. Clunky controls, boring storyâ€”it's enough to make you throw your controller (or worse, PlayStation controller) in the trash.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, all these new 3D games have new "radical" chracters like Croc or Bug or Crash. Where's the 3D adventure hero for those with classic sensibilities? Why are we ignoring our rich twenty-year video game history?</p>
        <p>If only someone made a 3D adventure game that moved us forward while still honoring the past. If only 3D worlds could be living, breathing worlds instead of one-off levels. If only there were clay pots you could pick up and smash...</p>

          <p>The Imaginauts over at Nintendo have been busy in their imaginariums imaginationizing the perfect 3D adventure game for the Nintedo 64. It's called <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>, and it can be yours to rent or own today!</p>
          <p>Stop wasting your time with "weekend rentals" that are barely worth playing through till Sunday. Discover a game so good, you'll spend each school night praying no one else rented it and erased your save file. Explore a world so immersive, you'll become fiscally responsible just long enough to save up to buy your own copy.</p>
