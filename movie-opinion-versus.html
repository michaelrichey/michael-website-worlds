  <h1>Perkbill and Crispy Go to the Cineplex</h1>

  <p>Hello, we're Perkbill and Cripsy, two film critics who couldn't disagree more, even though we're best friends. Here on our website, you can read all the dank reviews we've made about the films we've seen. Then you can decide if the film is worth your money, and you can find out which of us you agree with more, and therefore could be your fantasy best friend (in real life we're each other's best friends, so it's a no-go for reality).</p>

    <h2>Perkbill's Opinion</h2>
    <h3>Thumbs Down</h3>

    <p>
      <em>My Magic Dog</em> is another one of Hollywood's cash grab ghost dog movies, the first of which being Jim Jarmusch's independent film <em>Ghost Dog</em>, which kicked off the Ghost Dog craze.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the young boy petulant, the step-dad malodorous, and the dog insufferable at best. The subplot involving the Ghost Dog's carrying various trays through the living room to make it look like a ghost is haunting the place so yuppies won't buy the boy's step-dad's house was completely contrived and nonsensical. Why make it look like a ghost is haunting the house when <em>a ghost is literally haunting the house?</em> Absurd!

      <strong>Final score:</strong> 2 out of 5 coffee cups ☕️☕️

    <h2>Crispy's Opinion</h2>
    <h3>Thumbs UP!</h3>

    <p>
      <em>My Magic Dog</em> is a delight for the whole family. Even cynical teens and world-weary seniors can find something to love in this charming romp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the young boy delightful, the step-dad filling me with delight, and the dog delight-giving-to-me. The subplot involving the Ghost Dog's using his x-ray vision to look at a lady dog's skeletons was delight-ridden. Why not have a dead dog becoming aroused by the bones of a living dog? Genius!
