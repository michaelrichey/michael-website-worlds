        <h1>World of Ads</h1>
        <p>We at the Blue Arrow Ad Consortium belive there is a major problem with the online experience: too much content. Whenever you scroll through your favorite website, there is too much space devoted to articles and images and things you're looking for, that there's hardly any room for us to show you things you don't even know you need yet.</p>
        <p>That's why we created this site as an example for others to follow. More ad space, more ads, and more consumers shown things based on data we collected without their knowledge. We know what you want better than you do. After all, why else would you search "signs of diabetes" if you didn't want diabetes? Our ads will help you get the diabetes you're so desperately seeking, and so much more. That's the power of data collection.</p>
