  <h1>A List of Things Sonic Sez No To</h1>

  <img src="images/sonic-title.gif">

  <p>As you well know, Sonic is famous for waving and wagging his index finger. He's done this from his very first game on the Sega Genesis (MegaDrive in Europe and Japan) up until the present day.</p>

  <p>But why does the much fan arted hedgehod wave his digit thusly? It's not to be cheeky. In fact, it's because he's telling us all "no." He is making it clear that he does not want what you're selling and will not agree to join in on whatever scheme you're planning.</p>

    <p>Hopefully this non-exhaustive list will help you better understand what Sonic might say yes to, so you can have an easier time pitching him your ideas. Good luck!</p>
