        <p>Hi, and welcome yourself to the greatest website that there ever was. From now, there won't be any need for new ones. When you log on to the web from now on, come straight to this page first before visiting any pages made before this page existed. And don't try visiting any pages made after this one was made, because they don't exist. This is THE LAST PAGE EVER MADE ONLINE THE NET!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <p>And while you could visit older web pagesites, you needn't do it, because this one provides everything you could want. For example, here is a picture of Eek! The Cat:</p>

        <p>Now that the Internet is over, where will you go? What will you do? You still have the old Internet to peruse. But that will become boring after a while. Maybe you can draw some pictures and mail them to friends. Maybe you can write something and mail it to your neighbor. You can learn to sculpt and mail polaroids of your sculptures to your boss. If you're really ambitious, you could mail the sculpture. Either way, you'll need to get used to paying for a lot more postage.</p>
