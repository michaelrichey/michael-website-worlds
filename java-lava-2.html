  <h1>JAVA TIME!</h1>

  <p>Here we go!</p>

  <script>
    let butt = 'This is my butt';
    document.write(butt);
  </script>

  <p>You may think that the above statement about a butt was written like any other text on this page. But in fact, it was written in javascript.</p>

  <br>

  <script>

    function sayThanks(name) {
    document.write('You have entered the forbidden zone, ' + name + '! Ask the gnome cousins for directions.');
  }

  sayThanks('Mark');

  sayThanks('Isabella')

  sayThanks('you fool')

  </script>

  <br>

  <p>This statement above may also seem like it was born from paragraph tags, but that is not the case. Check the inspect element to see the TRUTH!.</p>
