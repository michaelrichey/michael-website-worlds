        <h2>WELCOME, CHILDREN, TO MY CRYPT OF WOE!</h2>
        <p>Hello there, wanderers. You have stumbled into my mausoleum of unnatural tales and spooky stories. I am V.L. Smythe, and I have been penning horror chapter books called <em>SHIVERSPINES</em> that have haunted the "pre-teen" section of libraries and Waldenbooks all over the world.</p>
        <p>I wouldn't blame you if you turned around and walked out of this website right now. Most do. But if you are in the mood for pages and pages of build up followed by a SHOCKING TWIST or a mild FRIGHT, then enter the world <em>SHIVERSPINES</em> and drink deep the non-alcoholic wine of FEAR!</p>
        <p>Below you will find a list of <em>SHIVERSPINES</em> books, IF YOU DARE! Find them at most Waldenbooks. And comings soon, the <em>SHIVERSPINES: CAMPFIRE NIGHTS</em> TV series airing soon at the witching hour: 4:00pm weekdays!!!!</p>
