          <h2>Chrono Cross</h2>
          <p>This game came out in 1999 right around the time everyone was playing Chrono Trigger on emulator. It was an exciting time to see screenshots and dream about how this purple hair kid and this Kidd kid would interact with the original party members. Turns out most of CT's story was thrown out the window, kind of like Alien 3 did to Aliens. CC is still a good game with a great soundtrack, but... it still hurts to see how much it doesn't connect to the original.</p>

          <h2>Final Fantasy VIII</h2>
          <p>After FFVII, anticipation for VIII was high. Maybe too high. Because when it came out, many absolutely hated it. Does it deserve that hate? Not really. Unlike Chrono Cross, all Final Fantasy games take place separately, so each one is different from the last. But still there was some X-factor that was missing from Squall that people liked in Cloud. They're both equally self-centered and arrogant. I think it was the hair. Going from spiky to swoopy was too much.</p>

          <h2>Legend of Mana</h2>
          <p>Having missed the excellent Seiken Densetsu 3, Legend of Mana was America's first Mana sequel (to be named, anyway). The visuals and music were gorgeous. But the loose and experimental story keeps the game from gaining momentum. Legend of Mana holds a special place in my heart, yet I still can't seem to finish it.</p>
